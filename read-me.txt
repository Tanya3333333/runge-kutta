Consider the pendulum and with a length l and a mass m. Using equilibrium of forces in the
polar system, the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) that describes the system can be written as: 

d^2(theta)/d(t^2) = -(m*g*r*sin(theta))/(I_G +(m*r^2))

Mass (m) 0.1270
Length = 0.3365
Distance from pivot point to centre of gravity (r) = 0.1778
Moment of inertia about centre of gravity (I_G) = 2.9 E-5

The algorithm for the Runge-Kutta 4th-order method in Matlab can solve the nonlinear ODE numerically with different theta values (found in lab at Simon Frase University)
amplitudes. 

Here the simulation of the pendulum is for 8s with a time step of â„Ž = 0.1s.
